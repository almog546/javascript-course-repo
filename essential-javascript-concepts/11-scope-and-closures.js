Scope:
// In JavaScript, scope determines the accessibility and visibility of variables and functions within your code. Understanding scope is essential for managing variable lifetimes and preventing naming conflicts.

// Global Scope:
// Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope. They can be accessed from any part of your code.
let globalVar = "I'm in global scope";

function printGlobalVar() {
  console.log(globalVar);
}
