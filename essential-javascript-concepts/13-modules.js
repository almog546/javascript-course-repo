// CommonJS vs. ES6 Modules:
// CommonJS is mainly used in Node.js, while ES6 Modules are natively supported in modern browsers and can be used in Node.js with some additional configurations.

// CommonJS uses require and module.exports, which are synchronous, while ES6 Modules use import and export, which are more flexible and support asynchronous loading.

// ES6 Modules have a more concise and readable syntax, making them the preferred choice for modern JavaScript development.

// In summary, whether you choose CommonJS or ES6 Modules depends on your environment and project requirements. For modern web development, ES6 Modules are the standard choice, but for Node.js or legacy projects, CommonJS may be more suitable.
