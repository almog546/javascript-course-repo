<!-- Local storage and cookies are two ways to store data on the client-side, meaning that the data is stored on the user's device. This is in contrast to server-side storage, where the data is stored on the server where the website is hosted.

Local storage is a newer and more modern way to store data on the client-side. It is supported by all major browsers and has a number of advantages over cookies, including:

Larger storage capacity: Local storage can store up to 5MB of data, while cookies are limited to 4KB of data.
Persistence: Local storage data is persisted across browser sessions and page reloads, while cookie data is typically deleted when the browser is closed.
Accessibility: Local storage data can be accessed by JavaScript, while cookie data can only be accessed by the website that created it.
Cookies are older and more widely supported than local storage. They are also smaller in size, making them ideal for storing small amounts of data, such as a user's login session or language preferences.

When to use local storage:

When you need to store a large amount of data on the client-side.
When you need to store data that needs to persist across browser sessions and page reloads.
When you need to access the data from JavaScript.
When to use cookies:

When you need to store a small amount of data on the client-side.
When you need to store data that is specific to a particular website.
When you need to be compatible with older browsers. -->
