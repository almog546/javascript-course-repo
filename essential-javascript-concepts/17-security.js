// Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention

// Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page. These scripts can then be executed when other users visit the page, potentially allowing the attacker to steal user information, redirect users to malicious websites, or take control of their accounts.

// To prevent XSS attacks, you should:

// Validate all user input: This means making sure that all user input is in the expected format and does not contain any dangerous characters.
// Encode all user output: This means converting any potentially dangerous characters in user input into harmless ones before they are displayed to the user.
// Use a Content Security Policy (CSP): A CSP is a security feature that allows you to whitelist the sources of content that can be loaded on your website. This can help to prevent XSS attacks by preventing attackers from loading malicious scripts from other websites.
// Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention

// Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that tricks a user's web browser into making an unauthorized request to a website. This can be done by embedding a malicious link in a web page or email, or by exploiting a vulnerability in a website's security.

// To prevent CSRF attacks, you should:

// Use HTTP-Only cookies: HTTP-Only cookies are a type of cookie that cannot be accessed by JavaScript. This means that even if an attacker tricks a user into visiting a malicious website, they will not be able to steal the user's cookie and use it to make unauthorized requests.
// Use tokens: A token is a random value that is generated for each request. The server can then verify the token to make sure that the request is authorized.
// Use a Content Security Policy (CSP): A CSP can be used to block requests to certain URLs, which can help to prevent CSRF attacks.
// Content Security Policy (CSP)

// A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that allows you to control which sources of content can be loaded on your website. This can help to protect your website from a variety of attacks, including XSS, CSRF, and content injection attacks.

// To use a CSP, you need to create a policy that specifies the sources of content that are allowed to be loaded. You can then add the policy to your website's HTTP headers.

// CSP can be a powerful tool for protecting your website, but it is important to use it correctly. If you are not familiar with CSP, you should consider using a third-party tool to help you create and manage your policy.
