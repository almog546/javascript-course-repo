// Minification and compression

// Minification and compression are techniques used to reduce the size of files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This can make your website load faster and use less bandwidth.

// Minification: Minification involves removing unnecessary characters and whitespace from files. For example, the following code:

// body {
//   font-family: Arial;
//   font-size: 14px;
//   color: black;
// }

// can be minified to:

// body{font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;color:black}

// This reduces the file size by about 30%.

// Compression: Compression involves using algorithms to reduce the size of files. There are a variety of compression algorithms available, but some of the most common for web files are GZIP and Brotli.
// Compression can reduce the size of files by up to 70%.
