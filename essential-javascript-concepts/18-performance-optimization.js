// Minification and compression

// Minification and compression are techniques used to reduce the size of files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This can make your website load faster and use less bandwidth.

// Minification: Minification involves removing unnecessary characters and whitespace from files. For example, the following code:

// body {
//   font-family: Arial;
//   font-size: 14px;
//   color: black;
// }

// can be minified to:

// body{font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;color:black}

// This reduces the file size by about 30%.

// Compression: Compression involves using algorithms to reduce the size of files. There are a variety of compression algorithms available, but some of the most common for web files are GZIP and Brotli.

// Compression can reduce the size of files by up to 70%.

// Lazy loading resources

// Lazy loading is a technique for loading resources, such as images and JavaScript files, on demand. This means that the resources are not loaded until they are needed, which can improve the performance of your website.

// There are a few different ways to implement lazy loading. One common method is to use JavaScript to load resources when they scroll into view.

// Asynchronous loading of scripts

// Asynchronous loading of scripts is a technique for loading scripts without blocking the rendering of the page. This means that the scripts are loaded in the background, and the page will continue to render while they are loading.

// Asynchronous loading of scripts can improve the performance of your website by reducing the amount of time it takes for the page to load.

// Here is an example of how to asynchronously load a script:

{/* <script src="script.js" async></script> */}

// This will load the script.js file asynchronously. The page will continue to render while the script is loading.








// ADITIONAL SAMPLES:

// Performance optimization is a crucial aspect of web development to ensure fast and efficient user experiences. Let's explore three key techniques for optimizing website performance: minification and compression, lazy loading resources, and asynchronous loading of scripts.

// 1. Minification and Compression:
// Minification:
// Minification involves removing unnecessary characters from code without affecting its functionality. This reduces file sizes, leading to faster downloads and improved performance.

// For example, consider the following JavaScript code:

// function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
//  var result = price * quantity;
//  return result;
// }

//After minification:

// function calculateTotal(a,b){return a*b}

// Compression:
// Compression further reduces file sizes by compressing them before transmission. Commonly used compression algorithms include Gzip and Brotli.

// Implementation:
// 1. Minification:
// Use minification tools such as UglifyJS for JavaScript, CSSNano for CSS, and HTMLMinifier for HTML.

// 2. Compression:
// Enable server-side compression. Most web servers (Apache, Nginx) support Gzip or Brotli compression. Ensure it's configured properly.

// # Nginx configuration for Gzip compression
// gzip on;
// gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;

// # Apache configuration for Gzip compression
// <IfModule mod_deflate.c>
//   AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain text/html text/xml text/css application/xml application/xhtml+xml application/rss+xml application/javascript application/x-javascript application/x-httpd-php application/json
// </IfModule>
