// Objects:
// Creating Objects:
// An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs. You can create objects using curly braces {} and populate them with properties and methods.
let person = {}; // empty objects

// objects with properties
let book = {
  title: "JavaScript for Beginner to Professional",
  author: "Laurence Lars Svekis",
  year: 2021
};

// Object Properties and Methods:
// Objects can have properties (variables) and methods (functions) associated with them. You can access and manipulate these properties and methods using dot notation or square brackets.

// Accessing object properties
console.log(book.title); // Access the 'title' property
console.log(book["author"]); // Access the 'author' property using square brackets

// Adding a method to an object
