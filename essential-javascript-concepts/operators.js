// Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %):
// 1. Addition (+): The addition operator is used to add two numbers or concatenate two strings.
let sum = 1 + 1;
let message = "Hello, " + "World";
console.log(sum + " " + message);



// 2. Subtraction (-): The subtraction operator is used to subtract one number from another.
let difference = 10 - 4;
console.log(difference);



// 3. Multiplication (*): The multiplication operator is used to multiply two numbers.
let product = 5 * 5;
console.log(product);



// 4. Division (/): The division operator is used to divide one number by another.
let quotient = 15 / 3;
console.log(quotient);



// 5. Modulus (%): The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation.
let remainder = 17 % 5;
console.log(remainder);






// Comparison Operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=):
// 1. Equality (==): The equality operator checks if two values are equal. It performs type coercion, so it may not be suitable for strict comparisons.
